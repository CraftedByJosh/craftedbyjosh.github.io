## Why?

I am not much of a writer, but I thought I would give this a shot. I have been wanting to start a blog for a while now, but I never really had a good reason to start. However, since I mainly write closed source code for work I realised I should attempt to do something to demonstrate my skills and knowledge.

I don't know how often I will be posting, but the aim will be to write about things I am working on or learning about, or anything else within the area of DevOps. I may even include some guides or tutorials if I think they are useful.

If you happen to stumble upon this page, I hope you enjoy reading my posts.

## How?

![Hugo - a fast and modern static website engine](https://gohugo.io/images/hugo-logo-wide.svg)

When first considering this blog, I was initially considering the use of HTMX + Go. With this I would be able to write a simple binary to deliver content. This could then be deployed using something like a AWS Lambda Function - probably not the most efficient but the always free tier would be enough for my needs. But then I would have to handle gateways and potentially paying for a domain.

I'm cheap and want to keep things simple.

So I decided the easiest approach would be a static website. Nice and quick to load, and I can host it for free on GitHub Pages. I haven't used Hugo before, but I have heard good things about it. So I decided to give it a shot. Honestly getting started with Hugo was super simple, basically follow the docs for a quick project setup, grab a theme you like and you are good to go. I have had to make a few tweaks to the theme I chose, but nothing too major.

The whole process only took about 30 minutes to get up and running so I don't reckon is worth going into detail about the setup. Here are some links to some of the resources I used:

- <https://pages.github.com/> - How to host a website on GitHub Pages
- <https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/> - Hugo Quick Start Guide
- <https://themes.gohugo.io/> --> <https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/archie/> - Hugo Themes
- <https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/> - Building and deploying a Hugo site on GitHub Pages

This way I hope to spend as much time as possible writing content and building the habit rather then engineering a solution to deliver the content. And if I ever decide to move to a different platform, I can easily do so, the main thing is to get started and figure out what works for me.
